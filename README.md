## Problem Statement and Background
- *How much Carbon Dioxide has been offset by renewable energy adoption within the last decade?*
  - My insperation for this question is becasue I have a passion for making data-driven decisions for a business or a company in order to help make decisions to increase growth and success within the company.
  - I also am extremely interested in the environment, and I believe data is the single most important tool for companies to make smart decisions on how they should approach their environmental decisions.
- I plan on making predictions based on
  - Renewable energy production globally over the past 10 years
  - Estimate carbon dioxide emissions that were avoided because of subsiituted renewable energy for fossil-fuel based energy production
  - Account for regional variations across the globe as well as lidecycle emissions of renewable and non-renewable energies
